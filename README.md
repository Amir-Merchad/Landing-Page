# Landing-Page
This Project is my second project in the Odin Projects course.
It is a simple landing page that contains a header, a hero section, 
a features section, and a footer. The website is built with HTML, CSS.
I'm applying the knowledge I learned in the course to create a simple and responsive landing page, using flexbox.
